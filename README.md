# VS Code Move File

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides an intuitive way to move files using a folder picker with fuzzy search, similar to Obsidian's file mover.

## Features

- Create new folders on the fly

## TODO

- Tab "completion -> writes the folder name to the text input" like obsidian does.
- Create folder if path doesn't exist.
